Recipe Generator React App

This project was done with a tutorial by DevEd on YouTube.

The purpose of the app is to render recipes based on a user's search.

I was able to practice my React skills, like creating classes, and stateless functions to render content.

I learned about and practiced using an API key.

I did the research outside of the tutorial to hide my API key. I created my .env file, and learned how to call the key in my app.js file.

In the future, I'd like to add a function that limits the results to a few per page. I'd like to turn each recipe into a link that takes the user to a page with a more intuitively styled recipe. The user could get the nutritional info, process details, and be able to print the recipe.
